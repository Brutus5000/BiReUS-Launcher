# BiReUS-Launcher
A launcher for applications versioned with [BiReUS](https://github.com/Brutus5000/BiReUS).

BiReUS-Launcher is an example or reference implementation for embedding BiReUS client into 3rd party applications.

It automatically checks out the latest version of your application and launches it afterwards. The patching process is logged in the GUI.

BiReUS-Launcher is based on BiReUS and PyQt (hence the GPL license in contrast to BiReUS).
